# asmek-authcogs

Alliance Auth cogs for Astrum Mechanica
This is built to replace some functionality of some of the *AA-Discordbot* as well as add other features.
This will not work without <https://apps.allianceauth.org/apps/detail/allianceauth-discordbot> installed!

> **Warning**
> This is built for ASMEK specifically. **If you aren't us, you probably shouldn't use this. There will be no warning of updates or changes!**
> However it is slowly being modified to contain less hardcoded values so personal use isn't off the table.

## Cog setup and usage

### About Cog

Accessed using `/about`

- Add the below lines to your `local.py` settings file, adjusting for your usage.

```python
ASMEK_BOT_NAME = "ASMEK Authbot: The Omnissiah" # name to show up in about 
ASMEK_BOT_DESCRIPTION = "Some spooky watching you description" # description for about
```

All settings are currently hardcoded

### Auth Cog

- Add the below lines to your `local.py` settings file, adjusting for your usage.

```python
ASMEK_ALLIANCE_ID = "123"
ASMEK_ALLIANCE_NAME = "alliance name"
ASMEK_ALLIANCE_URL = "alliance url"
```

Those will create the link for `/auth alliance`
Accessed using `/auth` followed by one of the below
Hardcoded links:
    Audit - Character audit (not member audit)
    Buyback - The buyback module
    Fittings - The fittings Module
    Home - Do i really need to explain??
    Wiki - The simplewiki module ( NOT WIKIJS)

> This cog still needs some work to make it more customizable and generate links based on individual setups

### Links Cog

A group needs to be given the `link.manage_links` perm in order to manage links
This cog conatins 2 seperate commands
`/links` is used to manage links, and `/link` is used to display a link

/Links
    Add - you will be brought to a pop up to add a name, url, description, and optional image for a link
    Edit - you will be brought to a popup to edit a link (current links will populate in menu)
    Delete - you will be asked to delete a link (current links will populate in menu)
    List - will list all current links

/Link
    will generate a list of all your links and upon making a selection will return the information

### HR Cog

Recruit channel, corp roleid, hr roleid, and recruit msg 1 are all required!
Additional recruit messages are optional and technically unlimited.
Messages below are what asmek uses as an example, a few points to note when modifying.

- the 2 pairs of {} in msg 1 are mandatory. The first set is to ping the recruit, the second set is to ping the HR team, in order to pull them into the thread.
- the messages must be enclosed in quotes ""
- `\n` is used for line breaks
- Discord formatting can be added

- Add the below lines to your `local.py` settings file, adjusting for your usage.

```python
ASMEK_RECRUIT_CHANNEL = "123"
ASMEK_CORP_ROLEID = "123"
ASMEK_HR_ROLEID = "123"
ASMEK_RECRUIT_MSG_1 = "Welcome {}! \n\nThis is your private thread for moving through the recruitment process with Astrum Mechanica.

```

### Siege Cog

- Add the below lines to your `local.py` settings file, adjusting for your usage.

```python
ASMEK_SIEGE_CHANNEL = "123" #channel for siege status
```

- The channel used for this should have permission set for no typing only viewing. You might have to set this from server owner.
- The channel should be completely empty with no existing chat.

You can change the status, along with the channel name, by typing `/siege` in any channel and choosing a corresponding colour(not color). It also includes preset messages but you can optionally type in a message as well(ie 30 man gang!).
We have this set as a role all on its own and give it out as needed.
In general the images are self explanatory, however we keep the beehive information partially opsec. See brackets below for how we explain it to general line members.
Recommended usage for imperium:

- Green: Beehive is up! All caps can be out. (General line members: you are as safe as humanly possible)
- Amber: Beehive is down! Only rorqs should be out. (General line members: its nullsec pay attention)
- Red: Everyone should dock up! (General line members: dock the fuck up!)

`ASMEK_RECRUIT_CHANNEL` |  | Discord channel id for recruitment threads

`ASMEK_HR_ROLEID` |  | Discord Role id for HR team, or the role to ping for recruits and also who can use the HR commands(not sure why i don't have the ability to use it tied to perms but meh)
